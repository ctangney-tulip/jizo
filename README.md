# Some-nameless-tool-to-make-a11y-reports-and-view-them
Very aptly named! ðŸ˜…

## What is this?
---
While working on some a11y audits (many, really) over the years, I quickly began to yearn for a quick and / or dirty way to generate reports utilizing the veritalbe plethora tools publicly available. In addition to just _making_ the reports, I really wanted to be able to interact with them _immediately_ in a way that was meaningful.

## Cool. What does... that mean?
---
If you've worked with tools like `@axe-core/cli`, you will be all too familiar with the process of reading through the reports that are generated in order to figure out what your scan turned up. In an alternate universe, humans would come equipped with a JSON parsing library capable of figuring out what was discovered in these reports at a glance. Until such a time, I wanted to devise a way to display this information in human-digestable chunks ðŸ˜†

## Neat!
---
If you're interested in getting started with this tool, there are a few things to keep in mind before proceeding. First and foremost, functionality is __limited__. Right now, users can only generate reports to pre-determined location on the client's file system. This build should be considered _pre-alpha_.

## Nitty-gritty! (Quickstart)
---
Let's get started by cloning the repo. Once you have done that, let's run:

```
npm install
```

This will install our required dependencies -- the key piece being our `@axe-core/cli`! If you are interested in what else this project is built on, go ahead and take a glance at the package.json.

That's it! F*cking crazy, I know!

To get started, just run:

```
npm start
```

## Known Issues
---
* No way to clear a report that has been loaded without refreshing the page. This is obviously not-ideal and is a poor user experience (in addition to everything else that is bad about this)

## Todo
---
[ ] Disable the inputs for the `axe__create-report` form during generation
[ ] Add toast functionality
[ ] Add a toast specifically for notifying the user that a report is done
[ ] Make it so a user can clear the report without having to refresh the page
[ ] Flesh out the object that is used to display the data from the report (add more than just errors)
