              <p class="mb-4 text-center">I've started putting together some basic functionality, such as running one-off reports against a URL of your choice, in addition to viewing the reports which have been generated.</p>
              <p class="mb-4 text-center">The current information displayed from the reports is limited <em>only</em> to errors. This should be kept in mind while working with your report, as much of the context will be absent until such a time that the application is fleshed out more.</p>
              <p class="mb-4 text-center">I'm one couch. Please be patient with my while I figure this all out :D</p>
