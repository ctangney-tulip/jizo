# Welcome!
If youâ€™re here, you are probably wondering how you can help get started.

First, make sure you've [cloned](https://github.com/ctangney-tulip/axe-viewer) the repository and are working using the correct version of Node (>14)

Next, head on over to the [task board](https://ctangney.nifty.pm/x5ASEsqABRO5A/task) and select a task to get started. There are usually a couple tasks marked `Good First Ticket` so look there to get your feet wet.

Be sure to assign yourself to the ticket for tracking purposes.

As always, be sure to follow the Code of Conduct outlined [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Cheers,
couch
